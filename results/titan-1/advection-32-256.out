Charm++: standalone mode (not using charmrun)
Charm++> Running in Multicore mode:  16 threads
Converse/Charm++ Commit ID: v6.8.0-beta1-82-g3bb3c5e
Warning> using Isomalloc in SMP mode, you may need to run with '+isomalloc_sync'.
CharmLB> Load balancer assumes all CPUs are same.
Charm++> Running on 1 unique compute nodes (16-way SMP).
